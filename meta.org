Yes, feel free to take all my content from Reddit and the paizo forums and quote it, paraphrase it, whatever. That's why I'm putting it on the internet after all, to help other people running the campaign.

In return please include attribution with links to the originals and send me a link to the final result when you're done. I'd love to read it!

If you just add “GM, Tabletop Gold podcast” that’s fine. If you want to add a URL, www.tabletopgold.com works. But either way is fine with me. Thanks! Seems like a great project, and I’m glad my comments might be useful.

Hi  :)

I'm working on a "Community Guide to GMing _Agents of Edgewatch_".

tl;dr: I would like your permission to quote the following posts/comments in that guide:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/h53fc3u/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

Since the same folks tend to comment on similar threads/themes, please let me know if I might consider similar forum comments you make (either in the past or future) to be so licensed, as well?

----------

This guide would be a collection of resources for running Agents of Edgewatch.

Primarily, links to forum threads and comments describing experiences and recommendations for the GM, including blockquotes of particular posts and/or comments such as the one I'm referencing above.

I'm still in a sort of "does this even make sense" phase of the project, so I have nothing public to share yet.

But I'd like to start securing agreements from people before we move too far away from the authorship of those comments.

   - My issue is with the fact that the players are supposed to get from lvl 3
     to lvl 4 mid dungeon but there are 2 occasions in which they might skip
     right trough. It would be climactic for sure to meet the final boss right
     away but it would spell the end of them as well.

   > This is a general problem with this edition of pathfinder, if the PCs find
   themselves in a situation even one level earlier than they are "supposed to"
   any fight quickly turns into a possible TPK.

   > The pacing at the end is god awful. The party is supposed to gain their
   fourth level as they get down to the basement, but when are they supposed to
   rest to gain all the new benefits like spell slots and so on? They’re
   investigating the murder mansion, finding all this evidence against
   Pratchett, but then they go back mid-investigation to rest — and it’s
   probably only around afternoon or so. So they can just leave and come back
   in the morning? Wouldn’t the Edgewatch send help, considering the evidence?
   But that would mess up the encounter balance. And what happens to the
   half-orc if her escape plan was triggered? She’s just going to stay there
   for, what, 12-14 hours, too afraid to confront the spirit?

   > It’s a mess. One of the failings of the AP model that requires a certain
   number of encounters in a single book. The hotel should be half the size to
   avoid this issue, and there should not be a level up shortly before the
   climax.

   - Paizo seems to LIKE overtuning things in 2nd edition

   - I'm DMing the last bit of book 5 right now.
   - I would say our group is doing fine. We had a big problem with that creature inside the armor in book 2, and we had our first death in those catacombs too. We had our second death at the end of book 3, with the boss rolling maximum damage at a critical hit against the sorcerer.
   - What I did to circunvent that awful process of cops looting people, the precint gave them gear according to table Party Treasure By Level.
