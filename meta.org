Hi [FIXME] :)

I'm working on a "Community Guide to GMing _Agents of Edgewatch_".

tl;dr: I would like your permission to quote the following posts/comments in that guide:

This guide would be a collection of resources for running Agents of Edgewatch.

Primarily, links to forum threads and comments describing experiences and recommendations for the GM, including blockquotes of particular posts and/or comments such as the one I'm referencing above.

I've posted an initial draft of the Guide at https://asynchronous.org/gms-guide-to-agents-of-edgewatch/; please don't re-share it just yet, thanks. :)

But I'd like to start securing agreements from people before we move too far away from the authorship of those comments.

Yes, feel free to take all my content from Reddit and the paizo forums and quote it, paraphrase it, whatever. That's why I'm putting it on the internet after all, to help other people running the campaign.

In return please include attribution with links to the originals and send me a link to the final result when you're done. I'd love to read it!

If you just add “GM, Tabletop Gold podcast” that’s fine. If you want to add a URL, www.tabletopgold.com works. But either way is fine with me. Thanks! Seems like a great project, and I’m glad my comments might be useful.

If I run this, I'd probably deal with treasure through a combination of better gear provided by Headquarters, contributions from grateful festival organizers, and letting the PCs' equipment level up as they advance. Definitely no looting bodies or pocketing arbitrary fines (or citizens slipping purses of gold into the officers' pockets).

Maybe add a supply officer NPC to the Edgewatch station who issues higher-level equipment as the PCs become authorized for it -- but only if they fill out the proper forms in triplicate, of course.

As for the new gear, it's a bit disappointing the nightstick is such a poor weapon. And I'm definitely not going to be using the blindpepper bomb and tube in my game, given the real-world issues around the casual overuse of tear gas and pepper spray. Maybe some sort of sleep/knockout gas alchemical weapon would be a better alternative?

At one point, the PCs, who are cops, wind up in a situation where they may have to beat citizens unconscious. And not depraved or awful criminals, just people in a bar who are belligerently drunk. Some of them are even Good aligned.

The AP encourages using social skills to deescalate the situation, and I don't think it's all that bad, but it stuck out to me as a bit awkward in terms of timing given real world events.

The PCs also get to 'fine' people and keep the money and return to the station and then requisition gear from defeated opponents...which, while it makes sense in-setting, given the use of civil forfeiture by real police it still leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. This part is easy enough to ignore or change in various ways, but it's less than ideal.

Those are really the only issues I found with it beyond the premise itself being poorly timed, and the first is not a big deal, just slightly off-putting.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE


A lot of people have been posting about how they are changing the "loot" system from the AP and I wanted to share my approach as an alternative that requires fewer bigger changes. I think the fact that Edgewatch doesn't have the funding is a good plot development to start with and I want to keep that aspect; however, I don't want to encourage "looting" civilians to keep pace with the game leveling wealth mechanics.

Instead, I want to do 2 things.
1. Give characters the choice to be responsible and require meticulously cataloging evidence or rewards given by grateful civilians. Through this, I plan to reward players further in the AP based on their choices to be responsible.

2. Have consequences for operating outside their responsibilities as city guards.

My goal behind that is for the players to choose the type of guard they want to become, but to have consequences for those type of decisions. This could mean their character being kicked from the force or imprisoned, which will equate, potentially, to character death from a story perspective.

There are districts with corruption and guards that are corrupt. The Edgewatch, however, under Lieutenant Lavarsus will not put up with those shenanigans. Those are just some thoughts I have around my run which I'm starting in about a month or so.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
From my understanding of civil forfeiture, the law set in the book is somewhat different to that. The guards are supposed to be only taking an amount of goods/money from the offending parties equal to or less than the amount of money that would be the fine for the crime, as opposed to civil forfeiture where the police take possessions from suspected criminals until they are able to prove that those possessions are not related to the crime.

Edgewatch's requisitioning here is supposed to be the punishment for the crime committed, whereas civil forfeiture is separate to any punishments the crime would normally warrant and can be arbitrarily much greater than the scale of the crime. A closer comparison to Edgewatch's policy might be traffic tickets that are paid on-the-spot.

Instead of being given all the leads they are at the beginning of this book, they instead only learn from Ralso that there's a group of thieves called the Copper Hand who are definitely planning to rob a bank using the radiant parade as a cover. From there I'm expecting the players come up with the following lines of investigation more or less on their own:

    * Get the route of the parade and compare it with the addresses of known banks: This will yield them a number of banks that are possible targets. I'm planning to include the 3 possible targets mentioned in the original but I'm also adding "Chadraxa's cheap loans" and "Vault of Abadar" as banks that the parade will pass by, maybe even some more.
    * Investigate the possible targets: This should be largely the same as the original except I'm gonna make a point of emphasising how big the Penny & Sphinx garden lawn is and how far away the main bank building is from the road.
    * Figure out where security is weakest: That should yield the information that the Token Guard is the most easily corruptible and unscrupulous district guard. (And that the Vault of Abadar is extremely well-guarded and unlikely to be the target)
    * Investigate the float makers: Some gathering of information in the Ivy District (where one of my PCs hails from) will yield the information that is available at the tannery in the original story, i.e. an apparatus has been stolen that was used in a play to make it look like Aroden was raising the Starstone out of the ocean.
    * Ask the other district watches if they've heard of the Copper Hand: That should yield an answer from the Stilt House. This is similar to the original story, except after they get the ledger at the smugglers' lair, they will not learn the exact location of the heist... but I'm not sure exactly what they should learn, probably something about what kind of supplies the thieves have purchased from the smugglers, e.g. sails and caltrops and stuff.

The final clue is the new PC joining the ranks

   > The pacing at the end is god awful. The party is supposed to gain their

   rest to gain all the new benefits like spell slots and so on? They’re
   investigating the murder mansion, finding all this evidence against
   Pratchett, but then they go back mid-investigation to rest — and it’s
   probably only around afternoon or so. So they can just leave and come back
   in the morning? Wouldn’t the Edgewatch send help, considering the evidence?
   But that would mess up the encounter balance. And what happens to the
   half-orc if her escape plan was triggered? She’s just going to stay there
   for, what, 12-14 hours, too afraid to confront the spirit?

   > It’s a mess. One of the failings of the AP model that requires a certain
