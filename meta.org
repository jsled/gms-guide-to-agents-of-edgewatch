Yes, feel free to take all my content from Reddit and the paizo forums and quote it, paraphrase it, whatever. That's why I'm putting it on the internet after all, to help other people running the campaign.

In return please include attribution with links to the originals and send me a link to the final result when you're done. I'd love to read it!

If you just add “GM, Tabletop Gold podcast” that’s fine. If you want to add a URL, www.tabletopgold.com works. But either way is fine with me. Thanks! Seems like a great project, and I’m glad my comments might be useful.

Hi  :)

I'm working on a "Community Guide to GMing _Agents of Edgewatch_".

tl;dr: I would like your permission to quote the following posts/comments in that guide:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/h53fc3u/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

----------

This guide would be a collection of resources for running Agents of Edgewatch.

Primarily, links to forum threads and comments describing experiences and recommendations for the GM, including blockquotes of particular posts and/or comments such as the one I'm referencing above.

I'm still in a sort of "does this even make sense" phase of the project, so I have nothing public to share yet.

But I'd like to start securing agreements from people before we move too far away from the authorship of those comments.

     to lvl 4 mid dungeon but there are 2 occasions in which they might skip
     right trough. It would be climactic for sure to meet the final boss right
     away but it would spell the end of them as well.

   > The pacing at the end is god awful. The party is supposed to gain their
   fourth level as they get down to the basement, but when are they supposed to
   rest to gain all the new benefits like spell slots and so on? They’re
   investigating the murder mansion, finding all this evidence against
   Pratchett, but then they go back mid-investigation to rest — and it’s
   probably only around afternoon or so. So they can just leave and come back
   in the morning? Wouldn’t the Edgewatch send help, considering the evidence?
   But that would mess up the encounter balance. And what happens to the
   half-orc if her escape plan was triggered? She’s just going to stay there
   for, what, 12-14 hours, too afraid to confront the spirit?

   > It’s a mess. One of the failings of the AP model that requires a certain
