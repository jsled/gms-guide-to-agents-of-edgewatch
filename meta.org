 - post https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/
   - My issue is with the fact that the players are supposed to get from lvl 3
     to lvl 4 mid dungeon but there are 2 occasions in which they might skip
     right trough. It would be climactic for sure to meet the final boss right
     away but it would spell the end of them as well.

   > This is a general problem with this edition of pathfinder, if the PCs find
   themselves in a situation even one level earlier than they are "supposed to"
   any fight quickly turns into a possible TPK.

 - comment https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/h53fc3u/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

   > The pacing at the end is god awful. The party is supposed to gain their
   fourth level as they get down to the basement, but when are they supposed to
   rest to gain all the new benefits like spell slots and so on? They’re
   investigating the murder mansion, finding all this evidence against
   Pratchett, but then they go back mid-investigation to rest — and it’s
   probably only around afternoon or so. So they can just leave and come back
   in the morning? Wouldn’t the Edgewatch send help, considering the evidence?
   But that would mess up the encounter balance. And what happens to the
   half-orc if her escape plan was triggered? She’s just going to stay there
   for, what, 12-14 hours, too afraid to confront the spirit?

   > It’s a mess. One of the failings of the AP model that requires a certain
   number of encounters in a single book. The hotel should be half the size to
   avoid this issue, and there should not be a level up shortly before the
   climax.

 - Zandu the Devourer:
   - "heavy loan to resurrect the two fallen"
   - I feel the foes in this campaign are a bit too strong, and after revisiting the amount of treasure they have received this far, they are severely underequipped.

 - narchy:
   - "I've spent the whole game ramping up treasure throughout. There's not enough that party consider legitimately theirs to take. They don't loot the bosses, the henchmen or general locations they go to because it makes them uncomfortable."
   - the AP IS hard if they aren't working together.

   - I'm DMing the last bit of book 5 right now.
   - I would say our group is doing fine. We had a big problem with that creature inside the armor in book 2, and we had our first death in those catacombs too. We had our second death at the end of book 3, with the boss rolling maximum damage at a critical hit against the sorcerer.
   - What I did to circunvent that awful process of cops looting people, the precint gave them gear according to table Party Treasure By Level.
