** General/Meta
*** "It's-a spicy meatball!"?

Like many APs, the Agents of Edgewatch is considered by some to be … "tuned hot" … "spicy" … "extremely deadly for PCs" … a "TPK machine".

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/oknoo0/agents_of_edgewatch_catacombs_are_a_death_trap/h59ksqb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][Some people saying this might be outliers, though.]]

- The bulk of the discussion at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/oknoo0/agents_of_edgewatch_catacombs_are_a_death_trap/]["Catacombs are a death trap"]] is about the general perception of the difficulty of these early APs.

*** Encounter Rebalancing
In general, in PF2E, when rebalancing encounters for a larger party, you should prefer "more weaker" enemies, not "single up-leveled" enemies.

- the PF2 math is too tight for even-stronger enemies
- too hard to land hits, too high chances of crits (both directions)

Thoughout this guide, we'll give notes on how others re-balanced.

** B1: "The Devil in the Dreaming Palace"
*** Title … spoilers, Paizo!

Just the name of this book is a spoiler combined with the fact that the Party meets Pratchett, who identifies himself as the owner of The Dreaming Palace in literally the first encounter the PCs have in the game. :(  Even Players who are not /trying/ to spoil themselves might come across the book name on the internet, including AoN.

Since you can't change the book name, there are a couple of options:

1/ Rename the Dreaming Palace. The name is not particularly important … feel free to change it.

2/ Skip the Pratchett+Ralso encounter in the Tipsy Tengu entirely.

I'd recommend the latter.

The encounter serves two purposes:

- Foreshadow Pratchett. There is no particular need to do so, and this extremely brief encounter doesn't particular serve to do so well in any case.

- Provide a reason why the skins of the drunk adventurers are flayed and hanging in Pratchett's trophy room (they broke his nose). Pratchett has plenty of motivation to kill anyone he wants (he's a sadistic serial-killer dick-hole), so there's no need to /motivate/ this.
*** C1: "The Mean Streets of Absalom"
**** "Guards Guards"
**** "Panic at the Zoo" / Knight's Marvelous Menagerie
**** Graveraker goes missing

The AP makes a point of the Graveraker going missing at this point.

It is extremely easy for a/ you to miss this point here in the text and b/ for it to be lost on the Party. It's another piece of foreshadowing that can get a bit lost.

The Graveraker does not come up again, until Book FIXME, but is an important plot point much later in the AP; the party will have a critical encounter within its strange extra-dimensional interior!

[FIXME: who, cite A or B] emphasizes making more of a point of it.

[[https://paizo.com/threads/rzs4349b&page=9?1-Devil-at-the-Dreaming-Palace#447][GreatGraySkwid has some good perspective about the Gravewalker going missing, here...]]

> The whole point of Graveraker's disappearance happening off camera is so
  that the actually qualified Agents of Edgewatch (i.e., not "our" party) can
  be dedicated to tracking down an established and well-known exhibit of the
  Festival, leaving our teams of rookie misfits to investigate a batch of
  people who may or may not actually be missing.

*** C2: "Missing Persons" / The Dragonfly Pagoda
*** C3: "Into the Undercity"
**** The Back Door

- [FIXME] Grolna relevance?
- Treasure
  - +1 rune

**** The House of the Planes

This section is intended to provide leads to Ralso and Pratchett, and to tie the missing stone masons to Ralso.

As written, it is extremely heavy-handed. Literally every NPC knows something absurdly relevant about Pratchett or Ralso.

In terms of priority, the following things "must" happen here:

- The party should meet Reginald Vancaskerkin, and ideally they should /like/ him.

- The party should find out that Ralso fenced some Minkainan stone mason tools, and she works at the Dreaming Palace.

- [Read The Alexandrian and invent two more clues, in case they don't find that one.]

Everything else is gravy.

- While Hoff will come back up later in the AP (Book 4), Hoff is not a plot-critical character.

- Book 4 does have a map of the House of the Planes, and I'll recommend using it. The location is interesting, even if this is just a social encounter.

*** C4: "The Murder Hotel"
**** Content Warning

This dungeon is no joke, either difficulty-wise or especially thematically.

You should make sure your Players are comfortable with the content here. *It's more important to make sure of that than to prevent spoiling things.*

Some people are going to have serious problems with – for example – mutated, deformed fetuses kept alive in jars! Some people might have real-life bad experiences with voeyurism!

It's okay if they do, and it's your job to only challenge them as much as they are comfortable being challenged.

Be kind.

**** The Dreaming Palace

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/][There are some concerns with the pacing/leveling in the Dreaming Palace]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/h5354t4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][u/Naurgul has some good advice on particular aspects of that]].

- (FIXME) You should have plans for what you will do if the party is split because 1 or 2 of them fall through one of the traps into the basement.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/p887ao/agents_of_edgewatch_spoilers_sidequest_ideas_for/][At least two groups have independently tamed the mimic into becoming a party "pet" or acquaintance. :)]]

**** Hendrid Pratchett encounter

Experiences with this encounter vary, but it is a Severe 4 encounter, and based on the time and physical constraints of this dungeon crawl, the party will likely be encountering Pratchett with below-full health and limited resources (consumables, spells) remaining.

> From my experience running him: Make sure he's spending actions to move
  around and using intimidate on the players. Essentially eat up his actions
  on thematic and interesting things that aren't attacks. Especially if they
  end up harassing the players or making the characters angry at him. He
  shouldn't be taking the party seriously, and should be trying to taunt them
  at least in the start of the fight.


This goes both ways, too. As in PF2 generally: the party using actions to force /enemies/ to spend actions is of good utility.

> The fight gets much easier if the PCs take out the children twin ghosts he has with him with RP instead of fighting. If they are reminded of their former lives they don't attack. So maybe give them a few extra hints about that. For example if they try to recall knowledge on them ask if they use society or religion; a successful society check should be enough to remind them of the twins they read about in their missing persons reports.

> I'm currently running AoE and we finished up the catacombs about a month ago. Overall, I'm not a fan of Book 2. I Think the author is the type who loves theory crafting monsters without really thinking about balance. I first noticed this with the copper hand illusionists in chapter 3 that are supposedly level 5, but are a full wizard/rogue. Their spell DC was higher than the party's optimized level 6 wizard. I'd be fine with that if they weren't also a full blown rogue.

> I ended up making some changes to to the eldritch ooze TYRROICESE cause I personally think that monster was just poorly designed. This is pretty much entirely was because the ooze template was used without really looking at how oozes work.

> - Not all oozes are immune to slashing/piercing (gelatinous cube), but those that are also have the split trait, basically cutting them in half with the HP split between the two. The benefit to splitting them is that you can then have your caster nuke them with AoE. The eldritch ooze got the benefit of immunities without being able to be split. (So I got rid of these immunities on the eldritch ooze)

> - Oozes are usually immune to critical hits/precision damage because they are just a blob of ooze so they don't have specific spots to hit for more damage. The eldritch ooze is a large suit of armor basically being piloted by an ooze. (I removed it's immunity to precision damage with the reasoning that the rogue and investigator would be able to find weak points in the armor to attack)

> - Lastly I made his pseudopod burst follow the standard MAP rule. As letting a solo encounter have 3 attacks at +23 when the party's AC is in the high 20s was just insane to me. His chance to crit was way above 50% with an average crit doing around 46 damage.

> Even with these adjustments it was a super close fight with most of the party unconscious and the remaining members sitting around 10-20 HP when they defeated it.

Instead of being given all the leads they are at the beginning of this book, they instead only learn from Ralso that there's a group of thieves called the Copper Hand who are definitely planning to rob a bank using the radiant parade as a cover. From there I'm expecting the players come up with the following lines of investigation more or less on their own:


    * Get the route of the parade and compare it with the addresses of known banks: This will yield them a number of banks that are possible targets. I'm planning to include the 3 possible targets mentioned in the original but I'm also adding "Chadraxa's cheap loans" and "Vault of Abadar" as banks that the parade will pass by, maybe even some more.
    * Investigate the possible targets: This should be largely the same as the original except I'm gonna make a point of emphasising how big the Penny & Sphinx garden lawn is and how far away the main bank building is from the road.
    * Figure out where security is weakest: That should yield the information that the Token Guard is the most easily corruptible and unscrupulous district guard. (And that the Vault of Abadar is extremely well-guarded and unlikely to be the target)
    * Investigate the float makers: Some gathering of information in the Ivy District (where one of my PCs hails from) will yield the information that is available at the tannery in the original story, i.e. an apparatus has been stolen that was used in a play to make it look like Aroden was raising the Starstone out of the ocean.
    * Ask the other district watches if they've heard of the Copper Hand: That should yield an answer from the Stilt House. This is similar to the original story, except after they get the ledger at the smugglers' lair, they will not learn the exact location of the heist... but I'm not sure exactly what they should learn, probably something about what kind of supplies the thieves have purchased from the smugglers, e.g. sails and caltrops and stuff.

The final clue is the new PC joining the ranks

*** content
Book 1- The Devil in the Dreaming Palace

This very solid start to the AP. It has a mostly self-contained story and
gives plenty of roleplay opportunities as a city guard, A good end villain
to face against and some interesting encounters. Others in this sub have
pointed out already three problematic parts in this book, but they are
relatively minor in my opinion:

- The chance encounter with the book villain in the very start is a bit too
  obviously foreshadowing- seeing the owner of the dreaming palace in an
  adventure named this way does not give much room to doubt. I found it not
  really disrupting, as the players could make some disconnect, but for
  another GM I would advise to just change the name of Pratchett's hotel.

 - the deadly zoo encounter- which includes two different monsters with the
   ability to petrify the party as well as a buffed rust monster, against
   which the party has to pace without a real chance to take 10 minutes of
   rest- is too much for most level 1 parties, including mine.

I gave my players the option to just tie up the monsters with rope after a
successful grapple check, and this gave a much easier win condition to the
combats while still being hard enough considering they had to go all over
the zoo with no rests.

- The agents, as policemen, being able to confiscate property freely feels
  weird in this part of the adventure, when they are mostly dealing with
  ordinary citizens. My group didn’t really care that much, but it was a good
  topic to raise in session zero and clear out our preferences on anyway. It's
  very easy in any case to just give the characters a salary.In my experience,
  later on in the AP, when the agents are dealing with criminals and cults, it
  feels much more justified to use what they can take, or to give it back for
  a bounty.

I would like to add another issue to this part as someone who finished running
the AP: The foreshadowing is a bit lacking in the following ways:

- Reginald Vancaskerkin is described in the book as someone who is "oily,
  nosy, and of questionable moral fiber", while the later books seem to think
  he has become a fan and friend of the party, at least until he backstabs
  them. I would advice playing him as someone who your players would like, and
  not a walking red flag as my reading of the first book alone implied to me.

- The Graveraker becomes an important plot point in the 4th and 6th books, Yet
  after it disappears somewhere in the start of this book, no mention of it
  exists in the AP for three whole books- at least not in a way major enough
  to remind the players it exists. My group totally forgot about it by the
  point the twists happened. I would advice all GMs running the AP to find
  ways to bring the Graveraker up a few times. Also, no art of the Graveraker
  exists in the AP at all. I would have really liked to see what it is like!


Book 2: Sixty Feet Under

This book is relatively straight-forward. The party follows a lead of trails
that leads them to stop a bank robbery, a thieves guild, and eventually a
serial killer.

Chapter 1

is a very strong point in this book- a less structured investigation sequence
gave an almost "open world" feeling while playing, with the party able to
choose the pace and theorize on where the robbery will take place. Running
this section was a lot of fun for me!

Chapter 2-

The robbery itself is okey - The robber's plan is kinda silly and they are
bound to fail, but it felt good having the party stop them and save the day
anyway. I feel that a GM taking the time to improve this scene could make it
into a much better moment than I had.

Chapter 3

felt a bit disappointing in my group, because there was an expectation that
another investigative part would follow the format of chapter 1. But the
infiltration into the copper hands hideout was still an enjoyable dungeon. Our
unlucky elf rouge got a minor case of lycanthropy from this part though-
nothing a visit to a temple could not fix, but this could have messed with
some plans.

Chapter 4

as a dungeon crawl was too long for our taste. It took us 3 whole 4 hour
sessions to get through it. And even with plenty of side quests happening in
there it was still a too long section of mostly combat in an otherwise more RP
balanced adventure. I would advise any GM's who feel the combat becomes
repetitive in their groups to shorten this part- there are enough simple
encounters to cut out of it without losing anything important


Book 3: All or nothing

This is probably my favorite book in the AP! It was the best at not only
giving varied scenarios to play in, but also providing GM tools to expand and
enhance those parts to their liking.

Chapter 1-

which involves resolving a gang war in the docks has some very flavorful NPCs
with interesting personalities, one of which (Maurrisa) Became a recurring NPC
in my game. This part is also relatively free in its structure and contains
some moral choices to make.

Chapter 2-

The casino heist is a very interesting chapter as well. Somehow the casino
games given did not translate well into our VTT experience, But the inclusion
of so many mechanics and tools to make the heist interesting is just great! I
am sure many GM's can make good use of this part- even as inspiration for home
games.

Chapter 3-

Gives the characters the task of dealing with a bomb threat in the middle of a
gladiator tournament. The scenarios given in the AP itself are quite
basic. But the tools provided, the various arena game mechanics and the flavor
text-gave me plenty of inspiration to expand this part into a mini tournament
arc- which was probably the highlight of the campaign! I highly recommend
customizing this part to your group's liking.

I have made another post in the past about a stat problem with the final boss
of this chapter- it has a mistake with its AC that makes fighting him a
breeze, so you might want to check it out before you run it.


Book 4: Assault on Hunting Lodge Seven

Chapter 1-

After a quick starting dungeon, this chapter including my favorite dungeon
experience of the AP. The blackfinger temple- with the convention in it's
upper floor, the puzzles, the interesting monsters, and the reasonable length
of it- was a very fun dungeon crawl!

Chapter 2-

In which the agents hole up in a haunted safe house to keep a watch over their
prisoner, is another interesting chapter. It is divided into parts which feel
tower-defense-like (protecting the house from assassins) and a small dungeon
crawl in the basement. After cleansing the haunted house and defending it for
so long, my players grew attached to the hunting lodge, so I gave them the
deed to the house as a gift from the city as thanks for their service. The
fact that the hunting lodge does not cointain any toilet in it became somewhat
of a joke in our group, and the players announced they are building one in the
house after they acquired it.

Small note about the final boss of this chapter- The lesser death is a tough
monster- with its disadvantage aura and high attacks, definitely has a
potential to kill a PC. My players have managed to exploit its teleporting
reaction to trap it inside the house vault (which I stated to be teleport
proof). That was a very proud GM moment for me, and I rewarded their creative
thinking with a homebrew item that the lesser death bargained for its freedom.

Chapter 3-

the investigation of harrowland was not interesting for my group. I think that
we are all missing the excitement about all the harrow lore in there- so it
felt like we were missing half the fun in there. Still, I imagine that for a
group with more golarion lore background this could be a nice theme dungeon.

The end of the book features the twist of Reginald framing the party. This did
not land that well in my group for a couple of reasons:- The framing plot
depends heavily on the Graveraker. About which most of my party forgot by the
time they got to this point. Foreshadow it more!- Reginald was obviously evil
from the first time they met him. So the reaction was more of "Oh finally he
shows he is evil and we an go kick his ass" and not the seemingly intended
shock.


Book 5: Belly of the Black Whale

This book has a nice change of pace from the previous ones- The agents have to
work now outside the law, as their badges have been taken from them after they
were framed. This gave the players many opportunities to test the moral
compass of the characters, and how much are they willing to do outside the law
to get their goals. Good RP stuff!

Chapter 1

deals with gaining enough favor with a crime lord to get the secrets on how to
break out the Starborn from the Black Whale prison. Miogimo the crime lord is
a good folly to the agents, showing how taking justice into their own hands
can make them end up. Overall, the chapter gives plenty of roleplay moments to
shine.

Chapter 2

is about the jailbreak from the black whale prison. The dungeon itself in
there is decent, but I needed to put extra work in to make it feel more like a
prison. Things like patrol routes, and more details about the day to day
management of the prison are lacking the way they are presented in the
adventure, I think this section could benefit from some clearer details.

After the prison break, the chapter goes again into a bit of an investigation-
where the agents need to find the evidence to clear their names and catch
Vancaskerkin, in my group at least we mostly glossed through this part,
because some details and npc's presented in the chapter were not working well
with the way things occurred in my game. This still seems like a nice
scenario.

Chapter 3

is the clockwork dungeon of Vancaskerkin. The dungeon itself is quite cool to
run. There are different difficulty levels for many encounters, some cool
monsters and a few secrets to discover. Reginald himself was a bit
underwhelming (At least to the power level of my party), My solution was
giving him 2 clockwork abilities at once, instead of just one, to up the
danger- worked quite well for me!

Another great thing about the showdown with Vancaskerkin is the alternative
win condition against him- instead of killing the villain, the players have an
option of resolving the conflict by exchanging his mind using a machine he has
build. My party went for this option, and Regi-mouse became a cannon part of
our Golarion.

In my opinion, the fight against Reginald felt like it should have been the
final one of the AP. He was behind all the troubles the agents faced so far,
and by defeating him, clearing their names and redeeming Starborn in the eyes
of the public, the agents can feel satisfied with their victory. I'll explain
my reasons for this below- but to keep a strong thematic sense, I would advise
to finish the campaign here- and avoid part 6. It is a perfectly
self-contained ending by this point.


Book 6: Ruins of the Radiant Siege.

Sadly, this last part of the AP is also the weakest in it. It has many
interesting ideas, but I'm afraid that as written, it feels off from the rest
of the AP, and does not contribute much to the story other than continuing it
to level 20.

Firstly, the big villain is someone who was basically invisible to the
players! Olansa shows up one time before this book, and this is just to shake
the characters hands and go away. At least the AP makes her presence clear
enough to the GM before this point, so some foreshadowing can be added- but
this is work the GM cannot be aware of unless they kept reading ahead, in
detail, and realize Olansa is not properly foreshadowed anywhere. It feels
especially hollow facing Olansa after defeating Reginald- who was there
plotting since the start of the game, and the characters have a really good
reason to hate.

This could be a minor thing should Olansa have been an interesting villain,
but as she stands in the book, she has no motivations. Her backstory seemed
shallow, it is unclear what, if anything, she would do should the characters
fail to dethrone her- the book gives no clue for us. It is unclear what her
motivation to take the throne is other than to get more power. This came off
to me very one dimensional and boring.

Thanks to a suggestion I saw in the Paizo forums, I altered her in my home
game to have the plan to steal the whole city of Absalom into a demiplane,
where she can rule it with an iron fist forever. But if you run it as is from
the book, she is stated to do next to nothing but sit in her tower and wait to
be defeated, other than maybe messing up some beurocracy in the city.

Secondly- This part of the adventure is a major change in tone from the rest
of the AP.This is even said on page 3 of the book, where the writer explains
the agents are now too strong for criminals to be a problem for them. So they
should retrain their social skills and get ready for some extraplanar monsters
popping in their way. I feel it's a bad note to finish a campaign focused on
using diplomacy to solve problems by throwing hordes of daemons and crazed
proteans at the party, and would have much preferred the adventure to stick to
the spirit of the previous books.

The chapters themselves are basically 3 big dungeon crawls, with no goals
other than to clear them out and get the relevant plot cupon. To the
adventure's credit, the design of the dungeons is interesting, but as someone
who likes shorter- more concise dungeons, They felt like they are dragging on
too much, with plenty of filler fights and encounters over the xp
budget. Filler fights are a common thing in any AP, but a book comprised of
mostely filler fights is dull to run in my opinion.


Chapter 1

has a dungeon happening inside a giant mech. This is a very cool idea, and one
that was foreshadowed before with the Graveraker (Though, not too well). The
most disappointing thing to me about this part, is that we never got any
detail's on how the Graveraker even looks, not to speak about any
illustration. Without those, it was hard to make sense of the situation, it
felt undefined in a disappointing way.

This dungeon also features the crazed proteans- who are stated to attack the
characters on sight, and no alternative means of defusing the situation are
given to the players, not even some reasonable solution like promising to free
them. I chose to allow such a solution to my players. But without it there was
next to no content in this dungeon as most of the rooms are fights with said
proteans.

Another thing happening in this chapter is the introduction of Il’setsya
Wyrmtouched, who appears out of nowhere to give the party their next quest
location, and escorts the party as a GMPC from then on. I chose to leave her
out of my game, and tie the plot advancement to other things .GMPC is an idea
I dislike, and it felt cheap to me to make the plot development of a story
nearing its end happen by a random character appearing out of thin air.

I also think that actually using her as written- where she has some "triggers"
later on In the book which cause her to act in a rash way and probably against
the interest of the party, and also possibly steal the show in the final
bossfight weather the party took her in or not- would be frustrating to deal
with as a player. I'm sure some GMs can pull this off well, but I am not one
of them.


Chapter 2-

In this chapter, the party needs to delve into another dungeon- the ruins of
an ancient fort constructed by an evil archmage bent on conquering Absalom
with an army of mind controlled angels- in order to find the item that will
allow them to face the final boss.

Before entering the dungeon, there is a section involving the use of the
research mechanics. Where the party needs to balance spending more days
getting prepared to the dungeon and gaining advantages in it with the risk of
getting caught by the deamonic agents of Olansa.The way my game played out;
the agents had too much stress on them to be able to research calmly for days
as the adventure assumes- so we largely ignored this mechanic. But this is a
cool concept.

The dungeon itself is nice. Though for some weird reason, the majority of
creatures and hazards in it have access to some variation of the prismatic
spray spell. So the dark tone of the location, at least in my group, was hurt
a bit by having rainbows assault the characters every fight.Also, there seems
to be an issue with the room size in the map- for example a room meant to
house 3 gargantuan creatures is physically too small to contain them.

The boss of this chapter- a fallen planetar- has a problem in his stats. He
possesses regeneration that can only be deactivated by evil damage, something
which the lawful good party, Which the players guide instructs to make, will
have no access to, meaning the PCs are unable to kill him in most conceivable
groups. I decided to ignore this fact and just treat it as fast healing, not
sure if there was a good reason to have it there in the first place.

Chapter 3

Dungeon number 3 in this book is an assault on the tower where the main
villain is sitting and… going slowly insane, waiting to be killed. Really this
calls for a change from the GM.For me, I upped the stakes by having Olansa
launch a daemon attack on the citizens of the city- and the players have to
stop her before she kills everyone.

The cool part about this dungeon, is the boss rush nature of it. To get to the
final boss, the agents combat against the reincarnations of the 3 bosses from
earlier in the campaign. (There are also many filler fights in this chapter,
which serve no purpose in my opinion- the players are level 20, they don’t
need to grind anymore.)

As written the boss rushs are cool fights, with enough to challenge the 20th
level characters, the only thing I would change in there is to enlarge a bit
the rooms they are found in, because they are too small for a dynamic fight to
take place in them.

The problem is, these fights are not going to run as written, unless your
players specifically avoid it there is an easy way to steamroll this entire
dungeon-The artifact the players gained in the end of chapter 2 allows them to
indefinitely mind control all the daemons present in there. I let my players
have some fun with the pokemon-esqe gameplay of capturing all the demons
(actually demon capturing sounds more like SMT but I digress) , until I had to
ask them by the end to not use the artifact they were given- or the game would
not be fun.

Olansa as a final boss is also quite unimpressive. Her ability to turn
invisible even to see invisibility feels cheap, and the poison on her weapon-
Teats of death- Is irrelevant to the combat because of its 1-minute onset
time. Even with her artifact equipped she is just not a very interesting or
challenging opponent as written. I heavily altered it for my session and would
advise doing the same to any other GM to make sure the ending of the campaign
is properly epic.

That's all for my thoughts! Thank you for reading so far! And I hope some of
my ramblings will be useful to GMs out there. Feel free to ask me anything in
the comments!

*** content
- The Graveraker will show up again in book 4. Show Bolera working on the
  Graveraker case. In my game, she's slowly uncovering some clues like
  mentioning that she thinks it was no coincidence that the zoo attack and the
  Graveraker theft happened at the same time, interviewing the inventor and
  making some vague references about a missing power source and the
  involvement of the radiant festival committee
  - No.  they'll have plenty of time with the Graveraker

- Some members of the festival committee and the grand council will end up
  playing major roles in the final books. So they should be introduced and
  interacted with early. I had my PCs give a brief 5 minute presentation in
  front of the radiant festival committee at the palace in Wise Quarter about
  their discovery of a potential bank heist plot.
  - why would the committee care about low-level police?

- Harlo Doleen ends up getting murdered which is a major plot point and
  twist. I made him be an acquaintance to one of the PCs. The PC used to be a
  slave and Harlo used to be his master. They have an awkward relationship now
  after not seeing each other for more than 3 years.
  - No.

- Vancaskerkin ends up being one of the main antagonists. Make Vancaskerkin
  prominent, especially through his tabloid Eyes on Absalom. Don't forget to
  tell the PCs about the frontpages of the paper (especially the ones that
  they are featured on), invite them for interviews, make them trust him as a
  partner they can go to ask for help. My players certainly have. For book 2
  Vancaskerkin will show up and warn the PCs about Pratchett trying to publish
  his memoirs from prison to create a favourable impression to the public
  before his upcoming trial.
  - Yes. They already have a good reaction to Vancaskerkin, though making him
    friendly/cooperative is probably a bridge too far.
  - Can he come up throughout?
    - Has he had the agents trailed out of the House of the Planes?
    - He's another investigator! Of course he can be helpful.

- Lavarsus ends up getting manipulated by the antagonists and arresting the
  wrong person. Play up Lavarsus as full of pride and incompetent
  - Takes credit for the agent's actions, for sure.
  - Continues to insult them, of course.

- The Irorium will be the setting of a big part of book 3. Make sure to
  mention it a few times. I had Oggrum (one of the gladiators the PCs will
  have to fight eventually) get a float in the radiant parade advertising his
  exploits.
  - Lucio probably knows of this.

- The Noxious Retort is an annual alchemical conference taking place at the
  Blackfingers temple. It will be showcased in book 4. Make sure your players
  learn about it beforehand if they are into alchemy or if they try to learn
  about Norgorber temples in the city.
  - absolutely, for Jobi
  - figure out Jobi's whole /deal/ w.r.t. Blackfingers

- House of Planes will be revisited in one of the later books. So it should
  probably be mentioned a few times. In book 2 I had my PCs track down one of
  the smugglers there after a botched attempt to raid their base of
  operations.
  - Could come back up in Book 2 or 3, sure

- The Lucky Nimbus casino will play a role in book 3. Make sure to mention it
  exists. I had an elaborate float advertising it in the radiant parade.
  - meh.

- The story of how the radiant festival started gets explored in book 6. I had
  a float featuring the half-angel in the parade
  - meh.

- The Harrow plays a role in book 4. You can introduce it earlier as a tarot
  divination art kind of thing without too much fanfare. Or you can have
  spooky card readings with your PCs.
  - No.

- Beldrin's tower in Precipice Quarter ends up being the place of the final
  confrontation. It should at least be mentioned earlier, implant the idea of
  visiting it for a tour while the festival is going on.
  - No.

- The Black Whale is a prison for important political prisoners that is
  visited in book 5. Give it a brief mention maybe at some point when
  appropriate.
  - Noted.

- Starwatch will eventually (in book 3) adopt the PCs and Starwatch Keep is
  where they'll get some offices of their own. Have them visit it early on if
  they want or make sure they've heard it at least. Same goes for Fort
  Tempest, make sure they've heard it exists.
