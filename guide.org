#+TITLE: The GM's Guide to "Agents of Edgewatch"
* Introduction
** Spoiler Warning

You're viewing a community-sourced Gamemaster's Guide to running the /Agents of Edgewatch/ Adventure Path from Paizo.

**This is entirely spoilers, by definition.**

** In Progress

As of November 2021, this guide is in progress and development. Your editor is compiling it as they run AoE for their group, so things will generally be added as the game progresses through 2021 and the first half of 2022.

See the [[Colophon][Colophon]] for how you can help contribute.

* Adventure Path Overview

/Agents of Edgewatch/ is the story of the player characters -- the titular
Agents of Edgewatch -- and their journey to understand and defeat the threat
of the Twilight Four, a cabal of devotees to Norgorber in their attempt to
take control of the Primarchy of Absalom.

In Book 1, the Agents will come up through the ranks.

In Book 2, the Agents will defeat the first of the Twilight Four – The Skinner – and her murderous cult.

In Book 3, the Agents will foil the plans second of the Twilight Four – The Infector – and his attempt to poison thousands.

In Book 4, the Agents will infiltrate The Infector's temple, capture, and hold them … but ultimately will be framed and arrested.

In Book 5, the Agents will first infiltrate and then break out of Absalom's high-security prison, then turning their attention to the third of the Twilight Four — The Rumormonger.

In Book 6, the Agents will obtain an artifact they need to defeat the fourth of the Twilight Four – The Gray Queen – newly empowered by fulfilling the terms of the Twilight Four's contract with Norgorber.

----------

The [[http:cite:reddit-pabt0r][AP doesn't make it in-your-face obvious up front about the goals of the Twilight Four or their pact with Norgorber]]. Only in the Toolbox entry for Olansa Terimor in Book *6* is the compact revealed…

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
While most who aspire to divinity in Absalom dream of passing the Test of the
Starstone, Olansa’s aspirations were both much more direct and much more
grounded. She pledged her soul to the Gray Master alongside the other members
of the Twilight Four so that when they collectively overthrew Absalom’s
rightful standing primarch and installed one of their own into power, they
would each receive a gift of immense divine power. There would be no need to
dare the unknown dangers within the Starstone Cathedral—only a single
momentous act of devotion to the God of Thieves.

** Adventure Path Length

This – of course – is going to vary dramatically based on the table at which the game is being run, how many side-quests and how much character-service is done, &c.

Based naïvely on the idea that characters should advance in level every 3-4 gaming sessions, a Level 1 - 20 Adventure should take between 55 and 80 sessions, or 1 - 1.5 years at 1 session/week.

This seems to be supported by the experience at some tables, with people reporting "1-2 years" to finish an AP.

[[http:cite:paizo-forums-rzs4349c_18][On the Paizo Forums, Kazimir_980 reports taking seven 3-to-6-hour sessions to get through book 1.]]

[[http:cite:reddit-n39df5][On Reddit, u/DragoldC42's group took 9 months for the entire AP.]]

[[http:cite:reddit-q9a8a1][u/Merithras asked a similar question that got some good responses, as well.]]

** Difficulty

Like many APs, the Agents of Edgewatch is considered by some to be … "tuned hot" … "spicy" … "extremely deadly for PCs" … a "TPK machine".

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/oknoo0/agents_of_edgewatch_catacombs_are_a_death_trap/h59ksqb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][Some people saying this might be outliers, though.]]

- The bulk of the discussion at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/oknoo0/agents_of_edgewatch_catacombs_are_a_death_trap/]["Catacombs are a death trap"]] is about the general perception of the difficulty of these early APs.

- [[http:cite:reddit-q42xy3][This thread from u/Sachiel2014 has a lot of great detail about specific ways things might be difficult for specific parties and tables.]]

----------

In general, in PF2E, when rebalancing encounters for a larger party, you should prefer "more weaker" enemies, not "single up-leveled" enemies.

- the PF2 math is too tight for even-stronger enemies
- too hard to land hits, too high chances of crits (both directions)

** On Role-Playing Police

Some tables will have objections or distaste for playing the role of police,
or perhaps more specific practices like doing lethal damage by default or the
AP-encouraged practice of "legalized theft" of property.

The publication of the Adventure Path was in fact delayed by multiple months
due to protests associated with the Black Lives Matter movement in the United
States in the summer of 2020. The AP in fact has some text detailing ways to
handle the main objections to how it assumes "policing" will be done in the
way that it is written.

Even still, some people fundamentally feel this Adventure Path is somewhere between "in poor taste" and "downright offensive".

The main objections are:

- The immediate discretion of the Agents – rather than any formal judicial process and jurisprudence – is strongly encouraged.

- Pathfinder 2e does lethal damage by default, and players take non-trivial penalties for attempting to do non-lethal damage.

- The PCs are encouraged by the AP to simply "requisition" any valuable gear or consumables they encounter from citizens in the course of their duty, in lieu of pay.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  - The agents, as policemen, being able to confiscate property freely feels
    weird in this part of the adventure, when they are mostly dealing with
    ordinary citizens. My group didn’t really care that much, but it was a
    good topic to raise in session zero and clear out our preferences on
    anyway. It's very easy in any case to just give the characters a salary.In
    my experience, later on in the AP, when the agents are dealing with
    criminals and cults, it feels much more justified to use what they can
    take, or to give it back for a bounty.

Police, stealing people's personal property for personal enrichment. Oof.

So, when I run this I'll have to redo the entire treasure system.
    #+END_COMMENT

- If even not immediately taken by the Agents, loot returned to the police is effectively fenced and the usual sale value (50%) is given to the Agents.

    #+BEGIN_COMMENT uncleared-quote
If I run this, I'd probably deal with treasure through a combination of better gear provided by Headquarters, contributions from grateful festival organizers, and letting the PCs' equipment level up as they advance. Definitely no looting bodies or pocketing arbitrary fines (or citizens slipping purses of gold into the officers' pockets).

Maybe add a supply officer NPC to the Edgewatch station who issues higher-level equipment as the PCs become authorized for it -- but only if they fill out the proper forms in triplicate, of course.

As for the new gear, it's a bit disappointing the nightstick is such a poor weapon. And I'm definitely not going to be using the blindpepper bomb and tube in my game, given the real-world issues around the casual overuse of tear gas and pepper spray. Maybe some sort of sleep/knockout gas alchemical weapon would be a better alternative?
    #+END_COMMENT

- The Agents are tasked to, well, be police: to enact violence on behalf of the State to resolve disputes.

  - The very first encounter is "beat a bunch of citizens unconscious".
    - cf. — cite:paizo-rzs4349b-52
      #+BEGIN_COMMENT uncleared-quote
At one point, the PCs, who are cops, wind up in a situation where they may have to beat citizens unconscious. And not depraved or awful criminals, just people in a bar who are belligerently drunk. Some of them are even Good aligned.

The AP encourages using social skills to deescalate the situation, and I don't think it's all that bad, but it stuck out to me as a bit awkward in terms of timing given real world events.

The PCs also get to 'fine' people and keep the money and return to the station and then requisition gear from defeated opponents...which, while it makes sense in-setting, given the use of civil forfeiture by real police it still leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. This part is easy enough to ignore or change in various ways, but it's less than ideal.

Those are really the only issues I found with it beyond the premise itself being poorly timed, and the first is not a big deal, just slightly off-putting.
      #+END_COMMENT

  - The Agents are tasked to – effectively — break up a labor action in the role of police, in Book 1 Chapter 2.

There are a number of solutions to these problems:

- Pay the Agents a salary to keep in line with Treasure By Level without making it a direct outcome of their activities.

- Simply change the rules to make non-lethal damage default and at no penalty; give all magical characters the [[https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1835][Nonlethal Spell Metamagic Feat (2)]].

  - Note that the Adventure Path does include some item and spells specifically to help address these issues.

- Create some sort of deus ex machina (eg. a magical badge) that provides objective truth regarding the "Lawfulness" and "Goodness" (or at least Neutrality) of the Agent's actions while in the field.

[[http:cite:reddit-q98yrs][u/Umutuku asks for some examples of play with the common alternative solutions]], and the [[https://rollforcombat.com/category/podcast/agents-of-edgewatch/][Roll for Combat : Agents of Edgewatch podcast]] has implemented some of these options, as well as others.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT uncleared-quote paizo-rzs4349b-85
A lot of people have been posting about how they are changing the "loot"
system from the AP and I wanted to share my approach as an alternative that
requires fewer bigger changes. I think the fact that Edgewatch doesn't have
the funding is a good plot development to start with and I want to keep that
aspect; however, I don't want to encourage "looting" civilians to keep pace
with the game leveling wealth mechanics.

Instead, I want to do 2 things.

1. Give characters the choice to be responsible and require meticulously
cataloging evidence or rewards given by grateful civilians. Through this, I
plan to reward players further in the AP based on their choices to be
responsible.

2. Have consequences for operating outside their responsibilities as city guards.

My goal behind that is for the players to choose the type of guard they want
to become, but to have consequences for those type of decisions. This could
mean their character being kicked from the force or imprisoned, which will
equate, potentially, to character death from a story perspective.

There are districts with corruption and guards that are corrupt. The
Edgewatch, however, under Lieutenant Lavarsus will not put up with those
shenanigans. Those are just some thoughts I have around my run which I'm
starting in about a month or so.
#+END_COMMENT
[[http:cite:paizo-rzs4349b-85][On the Paizo Forums, "tuxagon" shares some thoughts about their plans for a more minimal change to the system.]]

[[http:cite:paizo-rzs4349b-152]["thewastedwalrus" points out that the detestable real-world practice of civil asset forfeiture is not quite the same as what's outlined in the AP.]]
#+BEGIN_COMMENT uncleared-quote-paizo-rzs4349b-152]]
From my understanding of civil forfeiture, the law set in the book is somewhat different to that. The guards are supposed to be only taking an amount of goods/money from the offending parties equal to or less than the amount of money that would be the fine for the crime, as opposed to civil forfeiture where the police take possessions from suspected criminals until they are able to prove that those possessions are not related to the crime.

Edgewatch's requisitioning here is supposed to be the punishment for the crime committed, whereas civil forfeiture is separate to any punishments the crime would normally warrant and can be arbitrarily much greater than the scale of the crime. A closer comparison to Edgewatch's policy might be traffic tickets that are paid on-the-spot.
#+END_COMMENT

[[http:cite:paizo-rzs4349b-120][GayBirdGM]] and [[http:cite:paizo-rzs4349b-121][Sporkedup]] both offer some counterbalance: there's plenty of bad things that the heroes are supposed to fight against because that's what these games are about, and the rest can pretty easily be worked around.

--------------------------------------------------

This is an area of running the AP where it will be important to be very clear with your players (and ensuring they're clear with each other) to make sure that everyone is playing a game they are comfortable playing.

** United Paizo Workers

In October 2021 – about 1 year after the final book of /Agents of Edgewatch/ was published in December 2020 – Paizo labor organized and formed the /United Paizo Workers/.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/q85tgm/the_new_paizo_unions_logo_is_a_reference_to_the/][Their logo is a reference to the Kobold Worker's Union from Book 1, Chapter 2.]]

* Enemy Makeup and Composition

The following is a summary of the enemies and challenges as written in the AP,
book by book.  This can help answer questions about – say – the suitability of
Champion focused on fighting undead (vs. elementals), to help guide the
player's characters to meet the challenges in the AP.

* Party Makeup and Composition
** Alchemist

An Alchemist character who is a follower of Norgorber – even in his less-offensive "Blackfingers" aspect – might still create dramatic tension with the party, as it becomes clear early on that the Agents are on the trail of a muder cult of Norgorberites.

A main plot point from Book 1 through the end of Book 3 is the poison called "Blackfinger Blight".

A key event in Book 4 is the "Noxious Retort", a world-class Alchemical conference at the Norgorber temple in Absalom; the PCs will need to infiltrate this conference to advance the plot.

The Temple of Norgorber and NPCs in the AP can be used to great effect to provide foreshadowing, or even just as a downtime location if the PC wants formula or reagents.

On the other hand, "DragoldC42" points out that this does lead to lots of enemies with poison resistance…

#+END_QUOTE

** Champion

There is a non-trivial presence of undead throughout the AP. A Champion who takes [[https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=221][Shining Oath]] will have plenty of opportunity to weave that into their play:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You’ve sworn an oath to put the undead to rest. Add the following tenet to your champion’s code after the other tenets: “You must end the existence of undead you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the unlikely event you find a good undead, you can try to work out a more peaceful way to help it recover from its undead state rather than destroying it in combat, such as helping it complete its unfinished business and find peace.”
#+END_QUOTE

As a central part of Book 5 is teaming up with the "zealborn" undead master criminal Miogimo to advance the Agent's interests, this oath can create plenty of dramatic tension to play out, as well.

*** Hendrid Pratchett
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I have to say, Hendrid Pratchett is one of the scariest and abhorrent monsters
I've ever seen for Pathfinder. Facing this guy is worse than facing a
Shoggoth, at least you expect the eldritch horror to come if facing one of
them or know that they're around.

This guy is an act to follow for Chaotic Evil Villians, he's a charismatic
manipulator to where he's easily so trustworthy to any person that would
interact with him, yet so demented that the more you begin to peel away at his
alibi and hotel, the darker tones start to kick in and break away at you
mentally with each of his heinous crimes.

His form of revenge on getting hit with a mug is peeling away the skins of the
four adventurers or mentally torturing two people to kill each other and make
fake escape attempts that end up in vain, only for them to become scarred that
they can't even trust the help that comes to save them. The fact that he keeps
Ralso tied psychologically by having two dolls to act as her replacement
sisters and his other demented works of art. And let's not forget the two
ghosts he keeps as children to see him as a father figure.

James, congratulations. I am literally scared of this guy.

  - Book 1, pg 13:
    - "The zoo creatures themselves are acting unusually aggressive, with a
      starting attitude of hostile. This is the result of a rage-inducing
      serum called blackfinger blight. An agent of Jonis Flakfatter, one of
      the city’s high priests of Norgorber (and an important antagonist later
      in this campaign), tested his latest formulation by introducing the
      contagion into the animals’ water supply. An agent who succeeds at a DC
      15 Nature check realizes that this sudden hostility seems abnormal, as
      does the black froth around some of the creatures’ mouths, yet the
      Edgewatch agents aren’t intended to discover much about the contagion
      itself at this time. Rather, this is foreshadowing for the much larger
      role blackfinger blight will play later on in the Adventure Path, (see
      the campaign summary on page 76).

      The poison’s current formulation has a short half-life.  If knocked
      unconscious or restrained, creatures affected by the virus recover in a
      day or two.  None of the escaped creatures are currently capable of
      spreading the blight.

* Plot Notes
** Book 1: "The Devil in the Dreaming Palace"
*** Title … spoilers, Paizo!

Just the name of this book is a spoiler combined with the fact that the Party meets Pratchett, who identifies himself as the owner of The Dreaming Palace in literally the first encounter the PCs have in the game. :(  Even Players who are not /trying/ to spoil themselves might come across the book name on the internet, including AoN.

Since you can't change the book name, there are a couple of options:

1/ Rename the "Dreaming Palace" hotel. The name is not particularly important … feel free to change it.

2/ Skip the Pratchett+Ralso encounter in the Tipsy Tengu entirely (see [FIXME] link to below).

*** Book 1, Chapter 1: "The Mean Streets of Absalom"
**** Noise Complaint / Tipsy Tengu

As mentioned earlier, the title of the book matches the name of the hotel that the primary atagonist tells the party in their very first encounter.

It's a strange decision the AP authors made, here.

Changing the name of the "Dreaming Palace" will preserve the suspense throughout the book, and is recommended.

Also, just skip the encounter with Pratchett and Ralso in the Tipsy Tengu entirely.

The encounter serves two purposes:

- Foreshadow Pratchett. There is no particular need to do so, and this extremely brief encounter doesn't particular serve to do so well in any case.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The chance encounter with the book villain in the very start is a bit too
  obviously foreshadowing- seeing the owner of the dreaming palace in an
  adventure named this way does not give much room to doubt. I found it not
  really disrupting, as the players could make some disconnect, but for another
  GM I would advise to just change the name of Pratchett's hotel.

- Provide a reason why the skins of the drunk adventurers are flayed and hanging in Pratchett's trophy room (they broke his nose). Pratchett has plenty of motivation to kill anyone he wants (he's a sadistic serial-killer dick-hole), so there's no need to /motivate/ this.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- the deadly zoo encounter- which includes two different monsters with the ability to petrify the party as well as a buffed rust monster, against which the party has to pace without a real chance to take 10 minutes of rest- is too much for most level 1 parties, including mine.

I gave my players the option to just tie up the monsters with rope after a successful grapple check, and this gave a much easier win condition to the combats while still being hard enough considering they had to go all over the zoo with no rests.

**** The Graveraker goes missing

The AP makes a point of the Graveraker going missing at this point.

It is extremely easy for a/ you to miss this point here in the text and b/ for it to be lost on the Party. It's another piece of foreshadowing that can get a bit lost.

The Graveraker does not come up again until Book 4, but is an important plot point much later in the AP; the party will have a critical encounter within its strange extra-dimensional interior!

Many folks recommend making more of a point of it.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- The Graveraker becomes an important plot point in the 4th and 6th books, Yet after it disappears somewhere in the start of this book, no mention of it exists in the AP for three whole books- at least not in a way major enough to remind the players it exists. My group totally forgot about it by the point the twists happened. I would advice all GMs running the AP to find ways to bring the Graveraker up a few times. Also, no art of the Graveraker exists in the AP at all. I would have really liked to see what it is like!

You should make sure your Players are comfortable with the content here. *It's more important to make sure of that than to prevent spoiling things.*

Some people are going to have serious problems with – for example – mutated, deformed fetuses kept alive in jars! Some people might have real-life bad experiences with voyeurism or being spied on!

serious risk of a few bad rolls dooming a character or a party, despite any

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I'm currently running AoE and we finished up the catacombs about a month ago. Overall, I'm not a fan of Book 2. I Think the author is the type who loves theory crafting monsters without really thinking about balance. I first noticed this with the copper hand illusionists in chapter 3 that are supposedly level 5, but are a full wizard/rogue. Their spell DC was higher than the party's optimized level 6 wizard. I'd be fine with that if they weren't also a full blown rogue.

I ended up making some changes to to the eldritch ooze TYRROICESE cause I personally think that monster was just poorly designed. This is pretty much entirely was because the ooze template was used without really looking at how oozes work.

- Not all oozes are immune to slashing/piercing (gelatinous cube), but those that are also have the split trait, basically cutting them in half with the HP split between the two. The benefit to splitting them is that you can then have your caster nuke them with AoE. The eldritch ooze got the benefit of immunities without being able to be split. (So I got rid of these immunities on the eldritch ooze)

- Oozes are usually immune to critical hits/precision damage because they are just a blob of ooze so they don't have specific spots to hit for more damage. The eldritch ooze is a large suit of armor basically being piloted by an ooze. (I removed it's immunity to precision damage with the reasoning that the rogue and investigator would be able to find weak points in the armor to attack)

- Lastly I made his pseudopod burst follow the standard MAP rule. As letting a solo encounter have 3 attacks at +23 when the party's AC is in the high 20s was just insane to me. His chance to crit was way above 50% with an average crit doing around 46 damage.

Even with these adjustments it was a super close fight with most of the party unconscious and the remaining members sitting around 10-20 HP when they defeated it.

Tyrroicese has no senses but motion sense. Therefore I ruled that it will only be able to sense a PC that used a move action on its turn, and a PC that acted in a space Tyrroicese knows about without moving will be hidden from it.

My players figured this out by seeing how the creature reacts (with the help of a recall knowledge from the investigator) and were then able to strategize on that (the monk drew aggro by moving, and the rest stood as still as they could while sniping at the monster)

The casino heist is a very interesting chapter as well. Somehow the casino games given did not translate well into our VTT experience, But the inclusion of so many mechanics and tools to make the heist interesting is just great! I am sure many GM's can make good use of this part- even as inspiration for home games.

*** Book 3, Chapter 3: "Deadly Games"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Gives the characters the task of dealing with a bomb threat in the middle of a gladiator tournament. The scenarios given in the AP itself are quite basic. But the tools provided, the various arena game mechanics and the flavor text-gave me plenty of inspiration to expand this part into a mini tournament arc- which was probably the highlight of the campaign! I highly recommend customizing this part to your group's liking.

I have made another post in the past about a stat problem with the final boss of this chapter- it has a mistake with its AC that makes fighting him a breeze, so you might want to check it out before you run it.

*** Book 4, Chapter 2: "The Gervin Legacy"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In which the agents hole up in a haunted safe house to keep a watch over their prisoner, is another interesting chapter. It is divided into parts which feel tower-defense-like (protecting the house from assassins) and a small dungeon crawl in the basement. After cleansing the haunted house and defending it for so long, my players grew attached to the hunting lodge, so I gave them the deed to the house as a gift from the city as thanks for their service. The fact that the hunting lodge does not cointain any toilet in it became somewhat of a joke in our group, and the players announced they are building one in the house after they acquired it.

Small note about the final boss of this chapter- The lesser death is a tough monster- with its disadvantage aura and high attacks, definitely has a potential to kill a PC. My players have managed to exploit its teleporting reaction to trap it inside the house vault (which I stated to be teleport proof). That was a very proud GM moment for me, and I rewarded their creative thinking with a homebrew item that the lesser death bargained for its freedom.

*** Book 4, Chapter 3: "A Wonderful Time in Harrowland"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the investigation of harrowland was not interesting for my group. I think that we are all missing the excitement about all the harrow lore in there- so it felt like we were missing half the fun in there. Still, I imagine that for a group with more golarion lore background this could be a nice theme dungeon.

The end of the book features the twist of Reginald framing the party. This did not land that well in my group for a couple of reasons:- The framing plot depends heavily on the Graveraker. About which most of my party forgot by the time they got to this point. Foreshadow it more!- Reginald was obviously evil from the first time they met him. So the reaction was more of "Oh finally he shows he is evil and we an go kick his ass" and not the seemingly intended shock.

This book has a nice change of pace from the previous ones- The agents have to work now outside the law, as their badges have been taken from them after they were framed. This gave the players many opportunities to test the moral compass of the characters, and how much are they willing to do outside the law to get their goals. Good RP stuff!

*** Book 5, Chapter 2: "Belly of the Black Whale"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
is about the jailbreak from the black whale prison. The dungeon itself in there is decent, but I needed to put extra work in to make it feel more like a prison. Things like patrol routes, and more details about the day to day management of the prison are lacking the way they are presented in the adventure, I think this section could benefit from some clearer details.

After the prison break, the chapter goes again into a bit of an investigation- where the agents need to find the evidence to clear their names and catch Vancaskerkin, in my group at least we mostly glossed through this part, because some details and npc's presented in the chapter were not working well with the way things occurred in my game. This still seems like a nice scenario.

*** Book 5, Chapter 3: "The Rumormonger’s Stronghold"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
is the clockwork dungeon of Vancaskerkin. The dungeon itself is quite cool to run. There are different difficulty levels for many encounters, some cool monsters and a few secrets to discover. Reginald himself was a bit underwhelming (At least to the power level of my party), My solution was giving him 2 clockwork abilities at once, instead of just one, to up the danger- worked quite well for me!

Another great thing about the showdown with Vancaskerkin is the alternative win condition against him- instead of killing the villain, the players have an option of resolving the conflict by exchanging his mind using a machine he has build. My party went for this option, and Regi-mouse became a cannon part of our Golarion.

In my opinion, the fight against Reginald felt like it should have been the final one of the AP. He was behind all the troubles the agents faced so far, and by defeating him, clearing their names and redeeming Starborn in the eyes of the public, the agents can feel satisfied with their victory. I'll explain my reasons for this below- but to keep a strong thematic sense, I would advise to finish the campaign here- and avoid part 6. It is a perfectly self-contained ending by this point.

** Book 6: "Ruins of the Radiant Siege"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Sadly, this last part of the AP is also the weakest in it. It has many interesting ideas, but I'm afraid that as written, it feels off from the rest of the AP, and does not contribute much to the story other than continuing it to level 20.

Firstly, the big villain is someone who was basically invisible to the players! Olansa shows up one time before this book, and this is just to shake the characters hands and go away. At least the AP makes her presence clear enough to the GM before this point, so some foreshadowing can be added- but this is work the GM cannot be aware of unless they kept reading ahead, in detail, and realize Olansa is not properly foreshadowed anywhere. It feels especially hollow facing Olansa after defeating Reginald- who was there plotting since the start of the game, and the characters have a really good reason to hate.

This could be a minor thing should Olansa have been an interesting villain, but as she stands in the book, she has no motivations. Her backstory seemed shallow, it is unclear what, if anything, she would do should the characters fail to dethrone her- the book gives no clue for us. It is unclear what her motivation to take the throne is other than to get more power. This came off to me very one dimensional and boring.

Thanks to a suggestion I saw in the Paizo forums, I altered her in my home game to have the plan to steal the whole city of Absalom into a demiplane, where she can rule it with an iron fist forever. But if you run it as is from the book, she is stated to do next to nothing but sit in her tower and wait to be defeated, other than maybe messing up some beurocracy in the city.

Secondly- This part of the adventure is a major change in tone from the rest of the AP.This is even said on page 3 of the book, where the writer explains the agents are now too strong for criminals to be a problem for them. So they should retrain their social skills and get ready for some extraplanar monsters popping in their way. I feel it's a bad note to finish a campaign focused on using diplomacy to solve problems by throwing hordes of daemons and crazed proteans at the party, and would have much preferred the adventure to stick to the spirit of the previous books.

The chapters themselves are basically 3 big dungeon crawls, with no goals other than to clear them out and get the relevant plot cupon. To the adventure's credit, the design of the dungeons is interesting, but as someone who likes shorter- more concise dungeons, They felt like they are dragging on too much, with plenty of filler fights and encounters over the xp budget. Filler fights are a common thing in any AP, but a book comprised of mostely filler fights is dull to run in my opinion.

*** Book 6, Chapter 1: "Runaway Excavator"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
has a dungeon happening inside a giant mech. This is a very cool idea, and one that was foreshadowed before with the Graveraker (Though, not too well). The most disappointing thing to me about this part, is that we never got any detail's on how the Graveraker even looks, not to speak about any illustration. Without those, it was hard to make sense of the situation, it felt undefined in a disappointing way.

This dungeon also features the crazed proteans- who are stated to attack the characters on sight, and no alternative means of defusing the situation are given to the players, not even some reasonable solution like promising to free them. I chose to allow such a solution to my players. But without it there was next to no content in this dungeon as most of the rooms are fights with said proteans.

Another thing happening in this chapter is the introduction of Il’setsya Wyrmtouched, who appears out of nowhere to give the party their next quest location, and escorts the party as a GMPC from then on. I chose to leave her out of my game, and tie the plot advancement to other things .GMPC is an idea I dislike, and it felt cheap to me to make the plot development of a story nearing its end happen by a random character appearing out of thin air.

I also think that actually using her as written- where she has some "triggers" later on In the book which cause her to act in a rash way and probably against the interest of the party, and also possibly steal the show in the final bossfight weather the party took her in or not- would be frustrating to deal with as a player. I'm sure some GMs can pull this off well, but I am not one of them.

*** Book 6, Chapter 2: "The Radiant Spark"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In this chapter, the party needs to delve into another dungeon- the ruins of an ancient fort constructed by an evil archmage bent on conquering Absalom with an army of mind controlled angels- in order to find the item that will allow them to face the final boss.

Before entering the dungeon, there is a section involving the use of the research mechanics. Where the party needs to balance spending more days getting prepared to the dungeon and gaining advantages in it with the risk of getting caught by the deamonic agents of Olansa.The way my game played out; the agents had too much stress on them to be able to research calmly for days as the adventure assumes- so we largely ignored this mechanic. But this is a cool concept.

The dungeon itself is nice. Though for some weird reason, the majority of creatures and hazards in it have access to some variation of the prismatic spray spell. So the dark tone of the location, at least in my group, was hurt a bit by having rainbows assault the characters every fight.Also, there seems to be an issue with the room size in the map- for example a room meant to house 3 gargantuan creatures is physically too small to contain them.

The boss of this chapter- a fallen planetar- has a problem in his stats. He possesses regeneration that can only be deactivated by evil damage, something which the lawful good party, Which the players guide instructs to make, will have no access to, meaning the PCs are unable to kill him in most conceivable groups. I decided to ignore this fact and just treat it as fast healing, not sure if there was a good reason to have it there in the first place.

*** Book 6, Chapter 3: "The Gray Queen's Tower"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dungeon number 3 in this book is an assault on the tower where the main villain is sitting and… going slowly insane, waiting to be killed. Really this calls for a change from the GM.For me, I upped the stakes by having Olansa launch a daemon attack on the citizens of the city- and the players have to stop her before she kills everyone.

The cool part about this dungeon, is the boss rush nature of it. To get to the final boss, the agents combat against the reincarnations of the 3 bosses from earlier in the campaign. (There are also many filler fights in this chapter, which serve no purpose in my opinion- the players are level 20, they don’t need to grind anymore.)

As written the boss rushs are cool fights, with enough to challenge the 20th level characters, the only thing I would change in there is to enlarge a bit the rooms they are found in, because they are too small for a dynamic fight to take place in them.

The problem is, these fights are not going to run as written, unless your players specifically avoid it there is an easy way to steamroll this entire dungeon-The artifact the players gained in the end of chapter 2 allows them to indefinitely mind control all the daemons present in there. I let my players have some fun with the pokemon-esqe gameplay of capturing all the demons (actually demon capturing sounds more like SMT but I digress) , until I had to ask them by the end to not use the artifact they were given- or the game would not be fun.

Olansa as a final boss is also quite unimpressive. Her ability to turn invisible even to see invisibility feels cheap, and the poison on her weapon- Teats of death- Is irrelevant to the combat because of its 1-minute onset time. Even with her artifact equipped she is just not a very interesting or challenging opponent as written. I heavily altered it for my session and would advise doing the same to any other GM to make sure the ending of the campaign is properly epic.
