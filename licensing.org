Yes, feel free to take all my content from Reddit and the paizo forums and quote it, paraphrase it, whatever. That's why I'm putting it on the internet after all, to help other people running the campaign.

In return please include attribution with links to the originals and send me a link to the final result when you're done. I'd love to read it!

If you just add “GM, Tabletop Gold podcast” that’s fine. If you want to add a URL, www.tabletopgold.com works. But either way is fine with me. Thanks! Seems like a great project, and I’m glad my comments might be useful.

Hi  :)

I'm working on a "Community Guide to GMing _Agents of Edgewatch_".

tl;dr: I would like your permission to quote the following posts/comments in that guide:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ojp6to/agents_of_edgewatch_book_1_finale_im_in_doubt/h53fc3u/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

*Will you license your comment identified above as [Creative Commons, By-Attribution, Share-Alike, Non-Commercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), or other such compatible terms that you identify?*

Since the same folks tend to comment on similar threads/themes, please let me know if I might consider similar forum comments you make (either in the past or future) to be so licensed, as well?

----------

This guide would be a collection of resources for running Agents of Edgewatch.

Primarily, links to forum threads and comments describing experiences and recommendations for the GM, including blockquotes of particular posts and/or comments such as the one I'm referencing above.

I'm still in a sort of "does this even make sense" phase of the project, so I have nothing public to share yet.

But I'd like to start securing agreements from people before we move too far away from the authorship of those comments.
